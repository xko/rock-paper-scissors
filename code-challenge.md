# Fun challenge

Do you know the Rock Paper Scissors game? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors

## Jira Issue

### Title
Waste an hour having fun

### Motivation
In order to spend an hour of my day having fun,
I’d like to play rock, paper, scissors

### Acceptance Criteria
* Can I play Player v Computer?
* Can I play Computer v Computer?
* Can I play a different game each time?

### Technical constraints
* Doesn’t necessarily need a flashy GUI
* Use Scala
* Use best in industry agile engineering practices

## Guidance
* We wouldn't ask anyone to do a coding puzzle that we haven't done ourselves, so the people looking at your code understand the problem we're asking to be solved.
* We’re not too bothered with the UI.
* We are keen to see how much you think is enough, and how much would go into a Minimum Viable Product. As a guide, elegant and simple wins over feature rich every time.
* You have 10 days to return the deliverable but we expect you to dedicate no more than 10 hours to this challenge.
* Do you test drive your code? This is something we value and we will be looking for telling indicators of such in the code you produce. We'll also be looking for things like coverage, copy and paste detection, etc.
* We also like to see your ‘long division’ i.e. the working out of the problem in code.
* Run / build instructions are seen in a positive light, as it indicates you know how to work in that environment.
* We also consider the extensibility of the code produced. Well factored code should be relatively easily extended. Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard may be a natural extension, as in http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html or more crazy extensions like http://www.umop.com/rps25.htm are also possible.

## Deliverable

Keep rough track of the time you dedicate to this coding exercise. We will talk about it during the code review.

Please commit regularly changes in git. We won't penalize experimentation, quite the opposite actually. When you finish, send us a git bundle. To produce it, run, from inside the repository, the following:

```
$ git bundle create challenge-$yourName.git main
```

This will generate a git bundle file that you can send us.
